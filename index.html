    The Pedemontana Veneta  is the largest public work currently under construction in Italy. Once completed, it will be 94km long and connect 36 municipalities between Vicenza and Treviso. But at what price?
    <br>
    In different locations,  its construction has crossed through old landfills and uncovered toxic waste, threatening the biodiversity of these areas.
    It has also dispossessed the lands of about 3,000 farms, with serious consequences for farmers and their families.
    While the works are proceeding very slowly, this photographic project aims to be an observation of the impact that a huge public project can have on the landscape and the communities that inhabit it.
    <br>
    Superstrada Pedemontana Veneta SPA is a journey on foot in 36 stages, in the productive heart of the North East, realized with a mix of photography, satellite images, objects, documents and interviews with the locals.
    <br>
    A careful exploration aimed at mapping a road which was born to unite, but ended up dividing.

        <i>The workers cut the net that surrounded the “Forest of Hope”, and destroyed 25 thousand square meters of walnut trees, cherry trees, alders, rubies and cornus, grown over the last twenty years with the careful care of my father Giuseppe and my mother Speranza (Hope), died a few years ago.
